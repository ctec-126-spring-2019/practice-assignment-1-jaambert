    <h1>About me:</h1>
    
    <p>Hello!  My name is Jacob and have been taking classes at clark for three terms now and and working my way to applying for my masters in computer science at WSU.  I love sports and finding the best beers on earth.  For me, there is nothing better than finding a great place to eat and drink with some great friends.</p>
    
    <h1>Goals:</h1>
    
    <p>My goals for taking this class are to expand my abilities within the computer science realm to try and become as well rounded and well versed in this topic as possible.  I want to become excellent at a few languages and then build from there, so I have a long way to go! Last term I took the python class here at clark and really enjoyed all the problem solving and adapting that goes into making a functioning purposeful program.
    </p>
    
    <h1>Language History</h1>
    
    <p>I am very new to programming with only two classes under my belt (and by under my belt I mean that I have taken the classes) so far:</p>
        <ul>        
            <li>python</li>
            <li>html</li>
        </ul>
